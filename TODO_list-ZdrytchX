->[Done]g_mode_teamkill cvars
->[Done]cfg/normal and cfg/tk cfgs

[Done] g_hitsounds

*BGame

*CGame

[Done] dynamic alien blips
Add Polation-O-Meter
[Done] Speedometer-in-Fps-meter "hack"
[Done] cg_thirdpersonheight
[Done] cg_firstperson fixes for my own bent gun (no one has this bug afaik, it's not tremfusion specific as it happens on gpp too, ask me about it and I'll explain it. This isn't really much of a fix since the angle actually changes with elevation.)

*UI

Je ne sais pas :'(


***I need internet to do so***

*Game

Add Sixthly's /allstats patch (It's pretty!)
Add Sixthly's Feed/Kill Streaks patch

*BGame


*CGame


*UI



***Ones that need Jeff's permission or help, or even just so he knows (just so he's happy)***
*Game

Re-Name the admin.dat administrative rights flags for simplier and/or logical reference

Add Sixthly's Map Rotation patches (Also need sixthly's help, it'll be confusing for you too jeffy as it appears to me to be incomplete as if six didn't commit his latest changes)

Add VampireMode (May need help and need to make a new branch in case something goes wrong, it crashes my gpp-1.1 qvm occasionally at random times)

Add Smooth Alien Regeneration (May cause a crash, need to make a new branch too for this one, but the result is fabulous)
->Add Human dynamic health regeneration so when humans have no nodes, they don't die out so quickly as aliens tend to last a long time (which smooth alien regeneration will also fix)

Teamkill Mode (I can do solo, see top)
->Allow trappers to deal damage so we can have turrets shoot humans and trappers shoot aliens to prevent spawn camping (or we could use instagib maps, with only a rifle =[ )

*BGame

Add Challenge ProMode physics? (I successfully did it with Cuboid mod and people enjoyed it, was balanced (except chasing down aliens, but I can fix that too), so why not? I need the majority of the community's acceptance since this is a HUGE change to gameplay so this has to wait)

*CGame

Change the Human's FoV other aliens higher if cg_widescreen is enabled (or if jeff knows how to, depend on the ratio of r_(custom)height to r_(custom)width cvars. However we need to be cautious not to allow going past 160 degrees.

Add/Fix Chat bubbles/Boxes above player's heads (I Forgot what changes I made to my client)


*UI

*Other
