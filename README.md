# tremulous-derelict
Derelict QVM for the [DERELICT] server. The name was inspired by the gloom map remake, "Derelict" (called "Beyond Derelict" in tremulous)

Some client-side features include:
1. Speedometer
2. Interpolation-o-meter (use this to estimate how far ahead you need to aim in front or behind a target to compensate for Unlagged's inability to interpolate between the 50msec intervals)
3. Alien friendly vision. Yellow blips are structures and green are players.
4. Lots mpre
5. I can't remember seriously
